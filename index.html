            <header id="about-me"> <h2> About Me </h2></header>
            <p> Hello, my name is Joshua Sinclair and welcome to my portfolio! A little bit about myself: I'm 35 years old and recently married with two fur-babies. I have a great number of passions which include; video games, board games, reading, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Dungeons and Dragons, and woodworking. Although I'm relatively new to the web-development world, my previous career as a paramedic has given me many useful and relevant skills for web-development. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ability to be adapt rapidly to change and think critically under stress.</li>
                    <li>How to work effectively within tight deadlines.</li>
                    <li>How to think several steps ahead of where you are, so that you can find the best route to where you need to go. </li>
                    <li>That honesty, integrity and putting in your best effort every time will always see you through.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Prework Study Guide</h3>
                    <p> This website was built as part of the prework assigned for the Carleton Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript for use when studying. The website also contains a function that can randomly select which subject to study first.</p>

                <h3>Josh's Amazing Second Project</h3>
                    <p> This website will be my next project in the Fullstack Bootcamp Course. I'm sure that it will be fun to build and help me hone my skills!</p>

                <h3>Project Number Three, The Return of Awesome</h3>
                    <p>This will be replaced by my Third Project in the Course. I'm hoping that it will be the best one yet as my skills continue to grow and develop.</p>
