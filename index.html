            <p> Hello, my name is Joshua Sinclair and welcome to my portfolio! A little bit about myself: I'm 35 years old and recently married with two fur-babies. I have a great number of passions which include; video games, board games, reading, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Dungeons and Dragons, and woodworking. Although I'm relatively new to the web-development world, my previous career as a paramedic has given me many useful and relevant skills for web-development. </p>
