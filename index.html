    <p> Hello, my name is Joshua Sinclair and welcome to my portfolio! A little bit about myself: I'm 35 years old and recently married with two fur-babies. I have a great number of passions which include; video games, board games, reading, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Dungeons and Dragons, and woodworking. Although I'm relatively new to the web-development world, my previous career as a paramedic has given me many useful and relevant skills for web-development. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ability to be adapt rapidly to change and think critically under stress.</li>
        <li>How to work effectively within tight deadlines.</li>
        <li>How to think several steps ahead of where you are, so that you can find the best route to where you need to go. </li>
        <li>That honesty, integrity and putting in your best effort every time will always see you through.</li>
    </ul>
